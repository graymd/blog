My name is Malachi Gray.  I am married to the love of my life and we have an amazing little boy.  I am a Software Engineer writing Java and JavaScript during the day.  When I have some free time, I enjoy playing with JavaScript frameworks and learning more about programming in general.  I plan to write a weekly entry about programming with some of my other hobbies sprinkled in.  I hope you will find my posts both entertaining and informative!

###### Some tid bits about me:
* I came to the Software field after 6 years as a project analyst (think lots of spreadsheets) so I still have a LOT to learn.
* I am a certified pilot and hold my CFI (Certified Flight Instructor) certificate for single-engine, multi-engine, and instruments but I haven't flown in 3+ years.
* I LOVE black coffee.
* I reside in Mt. Pleasant in beautiful Charleston, SC.  
* My wife and I enjoy taking our son to the beach and exploring the low country as much as possible.
* We love where we live, as well as traveling to see what else the world has to offer.
* I enjoy watching Jeopardy and Game of Thrones.
* I LOVE the Washington Redskins and have become somewhat of a Notre Dame football fan as well (my wife doesn't give me much choice).
* I aspire to learn to play the acoustic guitar but never seem to have enough time!
* We have a sweet Cavalier King Charles Spaniel üê∂ and a CRAZZZZY cat üòº
