title: Installing AWS Certificates in AWS
---
Over the past few weeks I have deployed two sites using S3, Cloudfront and Google Domains.  For both of these sites I used Cloudfront's free SSL certificate and found the process beyond easy!  Even though this process is easy, I'm sure to forget something in the near future and thought I'd go thru the process of setting up the DNS information, setting up Cloudfront and adding an SSL certificate.



Go to Behaviors tab, edit, select `Redirect HTTP to HTTPS`.
